I often stream game development on [my Twitch channel](https://ermil.me/twitch), and for one stream, I decided to create an entire game during the stream. This game was the result of that stream. It was built in Unity, as I needed an engine I was confident in due to the limited time.

The game had a theme of dreams, and for a while, I didn't know what to create. During this time, I had the idea to create a clicker game, as it was simple and I was reasonably confident I could finish it during the time limit.

One part I struggled with was the art. I took a break halfway through, and then spent the entire second half of the stream working on the art. Whilst the art is't perfect, it's the best I could do.

Later that day, I was able to get a streamer to try out the game and give feedback. This is what he had to say...
