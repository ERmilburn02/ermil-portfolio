# Car Customiser

<Image src="car-customiser/CarRender.png" priority />

As part of a game development bootcamp, I was required to create a simple product configurator for new car models. I decided to use the Unity Engine, as I'm confident with it, which was important as I had to get the project done in a short stretch of time.

One thing I did as part of this project, was creating my own models. I did have to follow a tutorial, but I was proud of the low-poly cars I created.

One issue I did have with the cars, was flipped normals, although it was pretty simple to fix.

One of the requirements of the project was to provide a video explaining how I created everything, so that's what I did, and the it's below.
