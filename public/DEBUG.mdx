# Car Customiser

<Image src="car-customiser/CarRender.png" priority />

As part of a game development bootcamp, I was required to create a simple product configurator for new car models. I decided to use the Unity Engine, as I'm confident with it, which was important as I had to get the project done in a short stretch of time.

One thing I did as part of this project, was creating my own models. I did have to follow a tutorial, but I was proud of the low-poly cars I created.

One issue I did have with the cars, was flipped normals, although it was pretty simple to fix.

TODO: Talk about code

<Code language="csharp">
{`using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(MeshRenderer))]
public class CarCustomiser : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Singleton
    private static CarCustomiser m_Instance;
    public static CarCustomiser Instance
    {
        get => m_Instance;
        private set => m_Instance = value;
    }

    [SerializeField] private int m_BaseColorIndex = 0;

    private MeshRenderer m_Renderer;

    private void Awake()
    {
        Instance = this;
    }

    private void Start()
    {
        m_Renderer = GetComponent<MeshRenderer>();
    }

    public void SetCarColor(Vector3 newColor)
    {
        m_Renderer.materials[m_BaseColorIndex].color = new Color(newColor.x, newColor.y, newColor.z);
    }
}`}

One of the requirements of the project was to provide a video explaining how I created everything, so that's what I did, and the it's below.
